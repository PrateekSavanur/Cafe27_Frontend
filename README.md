# Cafe27 Frontend Clone

This project aims to clone the frontend of the Cafe27 website's catalog page. Cafe27 is a fictional cafe and restaurant, and this project serves as a learning exercise and practice in frontend web development using React.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to replicate the look and feel of the Cafe27 catalog page available at [Cafe27 Catalog](https://cafe27.in/catalog/8546). It includes features such as displaying menu categories, filtering items based on dietary preferences (vegetarian, non-vegetarian, egg), and using components like carousels and drop-down cards.

## Technologies Used

- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- CSS: Styling the components to match the original design.
